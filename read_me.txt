My practice of Linear Regressions using Kagle data Housing_Prices_Competition.
Also some practice in data exploration of missing data, inputations of None,
finding outliers and replacing it with mean or mode:

Linear Regression with one most correlated feature - least score
Polynomial Regression with one most correlated feature - a bit higher than first one
Multiple Regression of 25 features with correlation above 0.05 - maximum score of this type

Multiple Polynomial Regression very prone to overfitting of train set and because of that 
not applicable to test set in this particular dataset.
